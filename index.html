          gates of Hades shall not prevail against it” (Matthew 16:18). Plus, the church is how God is accomplishing His
          work on earth today.</p>

      <p>Environmental pollution is one of the critical issues for humanity. It is becoming a threat to life on earth.
        With the increase in pollution, living beings are less likely to live the healthy life that they used to live
        earlier. A lot of deadly diseases occur just because of environmental pollution. This problem is becoming
        critical day by day. Because of this speech we won.</p>

      <p>Science is a key element in this world. We had so much promising scientists here and they made cool things.
        They sure had a lot of promise, but sadly we still got second. It is fine though as I know they did their best.
